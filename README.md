# An Assignment from General Assembly
Must refactor this existing React project to include:
- 4 seperate quadrants, each displaying a React component
- 2 of them will display info from individual api calls
- 1 will include buttons which will load the api calls
- 1 will include 2 React Kawaiis - each of which must change their mood from sad to happy upon each api call.

## APIs
The apis I have chosen are:
- Pokemon API - Simple api that displays information related to Pokemon, I am using a URL that will display a list of Pokemon, and will add pagination to continuosly update the list on each button click - cycling through the 1000+ Pokemon.
https://pokeapi.co/

- Game of Thrones API - An api that displays information related to the TV show Game of Thrones. I will use a route that will provide a random quote on each button click.

## Overview

#### What is this homework?

Today we're going to work with some starter code that pulls from an API and refactor it!

**The objective of this homework is to:**

* Refactor this starter code to practice working with API calls.
* Familiarize yourself with React hooks.

#### Your tasks to complete this homework are as follows:

1) Clone down this repo for React Quadrants.

2) Two of your quadrants must pull API data from two DIFFERENT sources and display API data in some fashion in each. [Here are some example APIs for you to choose from.](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) 

3) One quadrant must have a [Kawaii](https://react-kawaii.now.sh/) of your choice in it. The Kawaii will be sad until BOTH API calls have been made, and then it will be happy! 

> NOTE: This command will fix the React Kawaii install issue: 
> ```npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps react-kawaii```

4) One quadrant will have a button to fetch API calls again.

** Good luck and have fun! **
